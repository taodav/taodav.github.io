                    Eggs stir-fried with tomatoes. As simple as Chinese dishes get!
                    This is one of those dishes where ingredient quantity/cooking methods depend a lot on personal preference.
                    So adjust according to how you like it!
                    The recipe here is how I've always made it and how my 阿姨 used to make it back at home!<br>
                    EDIT (140420): I previously said the cup of water was optional. I've made this again and DEFINITELY
                    think that you need water! Even more than a cup actually. If you stew everything together for an
                    additional 10 minutes the tomato flavor really starts to come out and blend with the garlic -
                    it tastes orders of magnitude more amazing!
                </p>

                        1. Chop the tomatoes and garlic. For the tomatoes I chopped them into eighths and removed the
                        stemmy portion. You could chop these smaller or keep them larger, depending on how you want your
                        tomatoes in your final dish (do you want mushier tomatoes (smaller) or more solid pieces (larger)).
                        Chop and dice garlic.

                        2. Beat your eggs in a mixing bowl.

                        3. Add oil to your wok/pan and fry your eggs over medium heat. Keep pushing the cooked eggs around
                        so that the uncooked eggs make contact with the bottom of the pan. I like to keep my eggs just
                        slightly runny when I remove it from heat. Transfer to a plate for use later.

                        4. Oil your wok/pan once again and fry your chopped garlic until fragrant under medium heat, about 1 minute.
                        Add your chopped tomatoes and incorporate with the garlic. Add the water and allow the
                        wok/pan to come to a simmer and simmer until tomatoes start to break down a bit. I like to add water to this part because it lets the tomatoes cook down
                        even more and results in a saucier/soupier dish at the end, and also allows the tomatoes to boil
                        longer and for the tomato flavor to really come out.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        5. Add the sugar and fried eggs into the wok/pan. Mix and continue letting the mix simmer until
                        the water reduces to the desired consistency, about 10-15 minutes. You really don't want to
                        skimp on the simmering! Add a dash of light soy
                        sauce to the wok/pan. Stir again gently, salt to taste and serve!

                        6. Enjoy on some rice! I made this along with some spinach and fried halloumi. I know this sounds
                        weird but I eat fried halloumi with everything!
